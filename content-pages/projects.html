        <p>i made this website using pure html, javascript, and css (of course you couldn't tell...)</p>
        <p>this is the first website i've actually finished, but not the first one i've made. it's mainly just for me to show off the Stuff i've made in my time on this earth! i hope what you find on here brings you joy or happiness or some other emotion that means something to you.</p>
        <p>i plan to continue adding content to this site so please i encourage you to check back some other time, something might be different :)</p>

                <p>course project made in a group of four other students. this project is essentially a finance tracker where the user can input their expenses day by day and receive a summary.</p>
                <p>my work for this was implementing almost all of the server-side functionality, including a database for user info validation and storing their data. i also made an API and various unit tests for the database.</p>
                <p>this project is just a github repository right now, and probably will be for the forseeable future, as we have no desire to continue working on it.</p>
