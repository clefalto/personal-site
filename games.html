                <p>game jam project made in 2 weeks in January 2024. it's a simple, albeit slightly challenging platformer about a piece of bread.
                developed solo, i did all the programming AND art AND sound effects.</p>
                <p>this was the first game i ever really finished and i'm really proud of what i was able to accomplish in the short time frame.
                    i encourage you to play it and see if you can beat the current speedrun record (1:47.000)!</p>
